**Insightify** is an experimental project that allows real-time scene understanding using a webcam and AI. It has two versions:

---

## üß™ Version 1 ‚Äì **Python-based Desktop Application**

This version uses **OpenCV**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, and **SmolVLM2** to describe the live scene from your webcam in real-time, directly in a Python environment.

### ‚ú® Features
- Captures live webcam feed using OpenCV
- Processes one frame every few seconds for efficiency
- Sends the frame with a natural language instruction to SmolVLM2
- Outputs real-time scene descriptions in the console
- Fully runs on CPU (no GPU required)

### üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `transformers`, `torch`, `opencv-python`, `Pillow`, `numpy`

### üîß Installation

```bash
pip install transformers torch opencv-python pillow numpy
```
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run
```python insightify_v1.py ``` <br>
press q to quit the video feed.

## üåê Version 2 ‚Äì Web-Based Application
This version is a browser-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that:

- Captures webcam feed from the browser

- Sends base64-encoded images to an OpenAI-compatible API

- Receives and displays the response inline

- Allows configuration of instruction prompts and request intervals

### üåü Highlights
- No installation needed, runs in any modern browser

- Customizable API endpoint, prompt, and interval

- Clean dark UI using CSS variables

- Fully client-side with no image storage (privacy-friendly)

### üìÅ Usage
- Open the ```realtime_video_processing_v0.1.html``` file in your browser.

- Grant camera access.

- run following commands as per you choice:
```
(tool_name) -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-Instruct-GGUF

(tool_name) -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-256M-Instruct-GGUF

(tool_name) -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-GGUF

(tool_name) -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM2-2.2B-Instruct-GGUF
```
note: you may need to add ```-ngl 99``` to enable GPU acceleration.
